# Javascript Essentials, and tricks

## What is this repository ?
* In this repository, i am keeping a reference for each javascript topic that needs to be understood very well, almost all of these topics are known and probably most of javascript developers understand them, but we always have some gaps in our understanding.

* I tried as much as possible to fill these gaps in this repository i tried to read as much books, articles and posts on stackoverflow related to each topic mentioned below, to be able to write a concise well descriptive file for each one of them.

* I am not claiming that this is covering everything, but i added as much as possible here based on my understanding for each topic.

* The topics and all explanations considers that you have already some experience in javascript, at least you know variables, objects and functions and you already worked with each one of them in javascript.

* Any contribution is much appreciated.
