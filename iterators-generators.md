## Iterable and Iterator Protocols

As ES6 introduced new syntax, it also introduced new protocols, these protocols can be implemented by any object respecting some conventions.

---

## Iterable protocol:

iterable protocol allows javascript objects to define or customize their iteration behavior such as what values are looped over in a `for .. of` construct.

### Iterable Built-in types:

some types has built-in interation behavior, this means that you can directly contrcut `for .. of` on these types example:

1. Array
2. Map
3. String

#### Example 14.0:

```javascript
const myArray = [1,2,3];
for(const num of myArray) {
	console.log(num);
}

// 1
// 2
// 3

```

As we can see in this example myArray (of type `Array`) has a built-in iteration behavior

---

### Non-iterable type: 

An example of non iterable type is `Object`, but we can make an `Object` iterable by implementing `@@iterator` method, this means that the Object or its prototype needs to have a property with key `@@iterator` this is available via a constant `Symbol.iterator`


`Symbol.iterator` is a zero argument function that returns an object, conforming to the iterator protocol


---


## Iterator protocol:

Iterator protocol defines a standard way to produce a sequence of values, an object is iterator when it implements a `next()` method with the following semantics

1. 0 argument function `next()` that returns an object 
2. The returned object should contain 2 properties `done` (Boolean) and `value` (Any javascript type value)

---


## How to make an iterable object

As we discussed for an object to be iterable it has to contain a property with key `Symbol.iterator` that contains a 0 argument function, where that function should return an iterator Object that contains `next()` method, where that method returns an Object that contains `value` and `done` properties :D !!!


#### Example 14.1: 

```javascript
let numbersIterable = {};
// After implementing `Symbol.iterator` numbersIterable became iterable object
numbersIterable[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
    let number = 0;
    // This returned object is called iterator object
    return {
        next: function() {
            if(number < 10) {
                return { done: false, value: ++number };
            } else {
                return { done: true };
            }
        }
    }
}
// for..of is introduced in ES6 and it is a consumer to iterables, you can't use for..of on non iterable objects
// Since we change `numberIterable` to be iterable now we can use for..of
for(let num of numbersIterable) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

## How to make an iterator(not iterable) object

As we can see from example 14.1 we had to create iterator object to make `numberIterable` iterable, but it is very important to differentiate between `iterable` and `iterator`, in the next example we will create iterator

#### Example 14.2: 

```javascript
let numbersIterator = function(max) {
    let number = 0;
    return {
        next: function() {
            if(number < max) {
                return { done: false, value: ++number };
            } else {
                return { done: true };
            }
        }
    }
}
const myNumbersIterator = numbersIterator(6);
while (true) {
    const current = myNumbersIterator.next();
    console.log(current.value);
    if (current.done) {
        break;
    }
}
// 1 2 3 4 5 6 undefined
```

## Javascript iterable based constructs:

1. `for-of` loop
2. `[]` array destrcuturing pattern 
3. `...` spread operator


---

## Generators:

Generators are based on iterators, every generator is an iterator, basically they are just an easier and cleaner way to write iteratorsØŒ as you don't need to keep state of value, or done.

Generator is just a function that has slightly different behaviour, that give the function the ability to pause and then continue exection later.


### Generator functions main characteristics ? 

1. Generator function is created by adding `*` in function signature example: `function* myGenerator() { /* body */ }`
2. Generator function will pause execution whenever `yield` is reached
3. When Generator function is executed it will return iterator that we can use to iterate all values.
4. We can use iterable based constructs on generators example [ `for-of`, `[] array destrcuturing`, `...` ]


#### Example 14.3:

We will write Example 14.2 using generators

```javascript
let numbersGenerator = function*(max) {
    let num = 0;
    while(num < max) {
        yield ++num;
    }
}
const numbersIterator = numbersGenerator(6);
while (true) {
    const current = numbersIterator.next();
    console.log(current.value);
    if (current.done) {
        break;
    }
}
// 1 2 3 4 5 6 undefined
```

Generator will simplify the code of iterator, and when a generator function is executed it will just return an iterator, and we can start calling `next` the same way we did it for iterator implemenation

---

### Generator delegation:

We can delegate another generator or iterable Object to do the work of current generator using `yield*` expression.

#### Example 14.4: 

```javascript
function* delegateGenerator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}

function* numberGenerator() {
    yield* delegateGenerator();
}

const myIterator = numberGenerator();
console.log(myIterator.next().value);
console.log(myIterator.next().value);
console.log(myIterator.next().value);
// 1 2 3
```
